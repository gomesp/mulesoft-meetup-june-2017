## So, again, why microservices? 

### Independent DURS (Deploy, Update, Replace, Scale): Each service can be independently deployed, updated, replaced, and scaled. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

### Compute resource utilisation is optimised to its requirements

<hr>

### Can be written in any language and use any data store. Optimised for the service requirements

<hr>

### Having its own datastore improves its independence and resiliency

<hr>

### Services are resilient and built to tolerate external failure

<hr>

### Time to market is fast. Built around functional full-stack teams.

## Is my organisation ready to adopt microservices?

1. Embrace the DevOps culture <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. Rapid provisioning of compute resources <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. Basic monitoring, where MTTR is more important than MTBF <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. Rapid deployment <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. Easy to provision storage <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. Easy access to the edge <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. Authentication/Authorisation <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
