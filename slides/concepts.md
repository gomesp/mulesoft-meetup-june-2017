## What are microservices?

<hr>

> Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together.

<hr>

> [...] architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms [...]

<hr>

> [...] services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment [...]

## Risks and benefits

<hr>

## Why microservices?

* Massive regression testing cycle for each software iteration <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
* Monoliths equals large surface attack area <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
* Because one part of the application has strict change control, the entire application needs to be under strict change control <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
* Time-to-market is slow <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Note:
* Security: "Insecure applications hidden behind firewalls make you feel secure until the breach happens..."
* Change control: "Because one part of the monolithic application and database holds sensitive data, all of it is subject to the most rigorous policies..."
